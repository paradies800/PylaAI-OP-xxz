# PylaAI

PylaAI is currently the best external Brawl Stars bot.
This repository is intended for devs and it's recommended for others to use the official version from the discord.

**Warning :** This is the source-code, which is meant for developpers or people that know how to install python libraries and run python scripts --> The official build is linked in the discord, which is the source-code converted into an exe so you don't need additional knowledge to run the bot. (You will have to go through a linkvertise link)

How to run : 
- Install python and git(tested with python 3.11.9)
- open a cmd and type `git clone https://github.com/MrMuff1nn/PylaAI-OP.git`
- run `cd PylaAI-OP`
- run `python setup.py install`
- and then run `python main.py`
- enjoy !

Notes :
- This is the "localhost" version which means everything API related isn't enabled (login, online stats tracking, auto brawler list updating, auto icon updating, auto wall model updating). 
You can make it "online" by changing the base api url in utils.py and recoding the app to answer to the different endpoints. Site's code might become opensource but currently isn't.
- You can get the .pt version of the ai vision model at https://github.com/AngelFireLA/BrawlStarsBotMaking
- This repository won't contain early access features before they are released to the public.
- Please respect the "no selling" license as respect for our work.
